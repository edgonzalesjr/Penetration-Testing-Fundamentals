## Objective
To gain practical, hands-on experience in the core stages of penetration testing - reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation - while developing analytical thinking and ethical hacking methodologies aligned with the responsibilities of a Security Analyst.

### Skills Learned
- Reconnaissance & Enumeration
  - Identified open ports and services (TCP scanning)
  - Discovered hidden web directories and user accounts
  - Interpreted scan outputs to assess system exposure
- Exploitation Techniques
  - Conducted brute-force attacks on directories and login credentials
  - Gained unauthorized access to systems ethically for assessment purposes
- Privilege Escalation
  - Analyzed local vulnerabilities to elevate privileges
  - Understood misconfigurations and poor permission controls
- Analytical Thinking
  - Interpreted tool outputs to form hypotheses about potential exploits
  - Evaluated each discovery for its significance in the attack chain
- Ethical Practice
  - Recognized the ethical implications of offensive tools
  - Practiced responsible hacking within a safe, legal lab environment

### Tools Used
- Kali Linux: Penetration testing tool to perform attacks on a vulnerable machine.
- VMWare Workstation: Isolated environment for testing and simulation.
- Vulnerable VM machine: boot2root virtual machine designed to practice remote exploitation and privilege escalation techniques.
- Nmap:	Service detection, port scanning, reconnaissance.
- Gobuster:	Web directory brute-forcing.
- enum4linux:	User enumeration from Samba shares.
- Hydra:	Password brute-forcing for authentication services.
- LinPeas	Privilege: escalation enumeration and vulnerability discovery.

## Outcome
- Practical Understanding of the Attack Lifecycle: Gained end-to-end experience with a simulated attack, from discovery to exploitation and privilege escalation.
- Bridged Theory and Real-World Practice: Reinforced foundational concepts with hands-on implementation, preparing for complex red team/blue team operations.
- Enhanced Threat Awareness: Improved recognition of common misconfigurations in SSH, Samba, and Linux privilege escalation vectors.
- Security Analyst Readiness: Developed a mindset for identifying vulnerabilities and anticipating attacker tacticsâ€”critical for threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability management in a Security Analyst role.
