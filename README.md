## Objective
To gain practical, hands-on experience in the core stages of penetration testing - reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation - while developing analytical thinking and ethical hacking methodologies aligned with the responsibilities of a Security Analyst.

### Skills Learned
- Reconnaissance & Enumeration
  - Identified open ports and services (TCP scanning)
  - Discovered hidden web directories and user accounts
  - Interpreted scan outputs to assess system exposure
- Exploitation Techniques
  - Conducted brute-force attacks on directories and login credentials
  - Gained unauthorized access to systems ethically for assessment purposes
- Privilege Escalation
  - Analyzed local vulnerabilities to elevate privileges
  - Understood misconfigurations and poor permission controls
- Analytical Thinking
  - Interpreted tool outputs to form hypotheses about potential exploits
  - Evaluated each discovery for its significance in the attack chain
- Ethical Practice
  - Recognized the ethical implications of offensive tools
  - Practiced responsible hacking within a safe, legal lab environment

### Tools Used
- Nmap:	Service detection, port scanning, reconnaissance
- Gobuster:	Web directory brute-forcing
- enum4linux:	User enumeration from Samba shares
- Hydra:	Password brute-forcing for authentication services
- LinPeas	Privilege: escalation enumeration and vulnerability discovery
- VMWare Workstation: Isolated environment for testing and simulation
